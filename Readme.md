# What?
This is a site that tracks your magic items. You know like that +1 sword of alacrity you have kickin' around in the
closet downstairs.
# Why?
I needed a site/concept for doing technology demonstrations and this is what I came up with.
# Where is the stuff I need?
You'll want to start by running `vagrant up`.
Once vagrant is up and running you can access the various pieces of the application through these URLS:
* magicitems website: http://192.168.56.102/
* magicitems API: http://192.168.56.102:8080
* neo4j(database) admin: http://192.168.56.102:7474/browser/
