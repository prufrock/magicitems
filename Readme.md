# What?
This is a site that tracks your magic items. You know like that +1 sword of alacrity you have kickin' around in the
closet downstairs.
# Why?
I needed a site/concept for doing technology demonstrations and this is what I came up with.
# Where is the stuff I need?
You'll want to start by running `vagrant up`.
Once all that is sorted you should be able to hit the neo4j databse at `http://127.0.0.1:8772/browser/`.
There are some html files, javascript and other bits but they are not displayable since I removed the webserver. I'll get to that next. =D
